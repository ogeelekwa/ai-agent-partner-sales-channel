# Your Shopify Sales Channel Template - React Router

This is a template for building your sales channel app [Shopify sales channel](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). It was forked from the [Shopify React Router app template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-react-router) with some concerns unique to our usecase.

Visit the [`shopify.dev` documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-react-router) for more details on the React Router app package.

## Quick start

### Update Shopify app config

The first thing you should do when setting up your Sales Channel app is update the placeholder values in the [Shopify config toml](/shopify.app.toml).
You must set the `client_id` to match the client ID in your shopify developer dashboard, and your `application_url` and `redirect_urls` to
match the URLs for your production application.

To learn more about working with app configurations, see the [developer documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration).

### Local Development

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Press P to open the URL to your app. Once you click install, you can start development.

Local development is powered by [the Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli). It logs into your account, connects to an app, provides environment variables, updates remote config, creates a tunnel and provides commands to generate extensions.

### Partner specific setup

**NOTE** We have added testcases that fail if any of these steps are missed. You can run `pnpm run test` to validate that
these placeholders have been correctly replaced.

For in depth documentation on how to integrate with Shopify refer to [PARTNER_DOCS.md](./PARTNER_DOCS.md)

#### Your app config

Getting up and running with this app template requires a few modifications. First up you must update the app [config](/app/config.ts) with your platform specific
text and URLs.

```ts
export interface PartnerConfig {
  name: string;
  logo: string;
  supportUrl: string;
  docsUrl: string;
  termsOfServiceUrl: string;
  publicApiKey: string;
  afterAuthRedirectUrl: string;
  isStagingEnv?: boolean;
}
```

Once this config file is updated your app homepage should update to show copy and links relevant to your platform.
You should feel free to update this template as you wish, but a few things should remain available on this page.

1. A link to your terms of service
2. The ability to manage what products are published to your sales channel (see [ProductPublishingCard](/app/components/ProductPublishingCard.tsx))
3. Relevant support and documentation links

#### Links back to the merchants project

Once your config is setup, you need to teach the app how to get your external links. There are two methods set up on the [PartnerProjectLinks class](/app/data/PartnerProjectLinks.ts)
`getProjectFrontendUrl` and `getProjectManagementUrl` you may fill in these two stub methods with a utility to fetch your relevant project links, or completely replace the class with your
own implementation, just ensure the urls are returned properly in the loader in [app](/app/routes/app.tsx)

### Authenticating and querying data

To authenticate and query data you can use the `shopify` const that is exported from `/app/shopify.server.ts`:

```js
export async function loader({ request }) {
  const { admin } = await shopify.authenticate.admin(request);

  const response = await admin.graphql(`
    {
      products(first: 25) {
        nodes {
          title
          description
        }
      }
    }`);

  const {
    data: {
      products: { nodes },
    },
  } = await response.json();

  return nodes;
}
```

This template comes pre-configured with examples of:

1. Setting up your Shopify app in [/app/shopify.server.ts](/app/shopify.server.ts).
2. Responding to webhooks. Please see [/app/routes/webhooks.tsx](/app/routes/webhooks/app/uninstalled.ts).

Please read the [documentation for @shopify/shopify-app-react-router](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-react-router) to see what other API's are available.

## Shopify Dev MCP

This template is configured with the Shopify Dev MCP. This instructs [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) to use the Shopify Dev MCP.

For more information on the Shopify Dev MCP please read [the documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/devmcp).

## Deployment

### Application Storage

This template uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to store session data, by default using an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.
The database is defined as a schema in `/app/utils/schema.server.ts`.

This use of SQLite works in production if your app runs as a single instance.
The database that works best for you depends on the data your app needs and how it is queried.

The database is not in source control and therefore will not be persisted between deploys. This is fine for our usecase, it simply means that a fresh
session will need to be created between deploys. If you have a need to use a persisted database, you can use any for which we have a [SessionStorage adapter package](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/blob/main/packages/shopify-api/docs/guides/session-storage.md).

### Build

Build the app by running the command below with the package manager of your choice:

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn build
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run build
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run build
```

## Hosting

When you're ready to set up your app in production, you can follow [our deployment documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/deployment) to host it externally.

[Manual deployment guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/deployment/deploy-to-hosting-service): This resource provides general guidance on the requirements of deployment including environment variables, secrets, and persistent data.

When you reach the step for [setting up environment variables](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web#set-env-vars), you also need to set the variable `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Gotchas / Troubleshooting

### Database tables don't exist

If you get an error like:

```
The table `main.Session` does not exist in the current database.
```

Create the database for Drizzle. Run the `setup` script in `package.json` using `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`.

### Navigating/redirecting breaks an embedded app

Embedded apps must maintain the user session, which can be tricky inside an iFrame. To avoid issues:

1. Use `Link` from `react-router` or `@shopify/polaris`. Do not use `<a>`.
2. Use `redirect` returned from `authenticate.admin`. Do not use `redirect` from `react-router`
3. Use `useSubmit` from `react-router`.

### Webhooks: shop-specific webhook subscriptions aren't updated

If you are registering webhooks in the `afterAuth` hook, using `shopify.registerWebhooks`, you may find that your subscriptions aren't being updated.

Instead of using the `afterAuth` hook declare app-specific webhooks in the `shopify.app.toml` file. This approach is easier since Shopify will automatically sync changes every time you run `deploy` (e.g: `npm run deploy`). Please read these guides to understand more:

1. [app-specific vs shop-specific webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe#app-specific-subscriptions)
2. [Create a subscription tutorial](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe/get-started?deliveryMethod=https)

If you do need shop-specific webhooks, keep in mind that the package calls `afterAuth` in 2 scenarios:

- After installing the app
- When an access token expires

During normal development, the app won't need to re-authenticate most of the time, so shop-specific subscriptions aren't updated. To force your app to update the subscriptions, uninstall and reinstall the app. Revisiting the app will call the `afterAuth` hook.

### Webhooks: Admin created webhook failing HMAC validation

Webhooks subscriptions created in the [Shopify admin](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/notifications/webhooks) will fail HMAC validation. This is because the webhook payload is not signed with your app's secret key.

The recommended solution is to use [app-specific webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe#app-specific-subscriptions) defined in your toml file instead. Test your webhooks by triggering events manually in the Shopify admin(e.g. Updating the product title to trigger a `PRODUCTS_UPDATE`).

### Webhooks: Admin object undefined on webhook events triggered by the CLI

When you trigger a webhook event using the Shopify CLI, the `admin` object will be `undefined`. This is because the CLI triggers an event with a valid, but non-existent, shop. The `admin` object is only available when the webhook is triggered by a shop that has installed the app. This is expected.

Webhooks triggered by the CLI are intended for initial experimentation testing of your webhook configuration. For more information on how to test your webhooks, see the [Shopify CLI documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/commands#webhook-trigger).

### Incorrect GraphQL Hints

By default the [graphql.vscode-graphql](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) extension for will assume that GraphQL queries or mutations are for the [Shopify Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin). This is a sensible default, but it may not be true if:

1. You use another Shopify API such as the storefront API.
2. You use a third party GraphQL API.

If so, please update [.graphqlrc.ts](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-react-router/blob/main/.graphqlrc.ts).

### Using Defer & await for streaming responses

By default the CLI uses a cloudflare tunnel. Unfortunately cloudflare tunnels wait for the Response stream to finish, then sends one chunk. This will not affect production.

To test [streaming using await](https://reactrouter.com/api/components/Await#await) during local development we recommend [localhost based development](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/networking-options#localhost-based-development).

### "nbf" claim timestamp check failed

This is because a JWT token is expired. If you are consistently getting this error, it could be that the clock on your machine is not in sync with the server. To fix this ensure you have enabled "Set time and date automatically" in the "Date and Time" settings on your computer.
